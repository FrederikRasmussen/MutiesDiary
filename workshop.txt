description=[h2]Functionality[/h2]
description=
description=Adds a craftable diary item. Each day, your experiences will be remembered and can be written down in the journal. This means you can only write down experiences from days that have fully passed (triggers at midnight).
description=
description=You write down all XP earned for the day (before multipliers) and all recipes you know in each entry. If you die and make a new character, you can read the diary to regain all the XP (and apply your current multipliers). This means you'll have to re-read skill books as you re-read your diary. You'll regain a whole day's worth of XP at once and it will work like individual pages in a skill book.
description=
description=If your traits differ from the person who wrote the entry, you'll have a penalty applied for each trait's difference. By default, some traits (strength/fitness and weight related) are ignored.
description=
description=It is also possible to study a diary (even others' diaries can be studied!). When studying, you'll look for entries that have XP in skills that are equal to or higher than your current skill level. When you find an entry, you'll read it carefully and gain an XP boost for as much XP as was in that entry. Only the best entry read applies.
description=
description=Studying is adjustable with sandbox settings. Traits ignored are also adjustable.
